# WeBash
A javascript terminal emulator for websites
A nodeJS API that provides output of commands you sent to it

## I don't understand...
Always dreamed to have your website feel like a terminal ?
Build it with WeBash ! WeBash is a contraction of 'Web' and 'Bash'.


The users will be able to navigate throught your website (or just a part of it) using commands provided by WeBash API. If you choose to use WeBash for a entire website, it will be one-page : WeBash will carry informations from other pages to bring them to the user, who does not move from your CLI.
Note that you have to build the command line interface, WeBash only provides output of commands.

## Commands
You can get the commands list by sending 'help --list' to the API.
You can suggest new commands by opening an issue on GitHub.
The project is still under developpement, important commands may be missing because we are working on them.

## How to use it ?
The requests must be sent to `https://webash.taokann.one/api/v1/<your command here>`
  
ex: `https://webash.taokann.one/api/v1/echo Hello World!`
Will return : 
  
```javascript
  {
    "status": "sucess",
    "output": "Hello World!"
  }
```
  
The testing branch is available at : `https://testing.webash.taokann.one/api/v1/`

You will get the output in response.

## Self-hosting
The `master` branch is always stable and working, whereas the `testing` branch is where the developpers work, so you should not use it. When a new feature is ready, we will merge it into `master`

To host an instance, start by cloning the repository :

```
git clone https://github.com/taokann/WeBash.git
cd WeBash
npm install
npm start
```

### .env
Customize your instance by modifying the `.env` file!

### Docker
A `docker-compose.yml` and a `Dockerfile` are available.
You can (and should) use the .env file

## Contribute
First of all, thank you for contributing!

### Adding command
To add a command, create a file named after it in `./res/commands`

Then you will have to create three functions:

`query` is an array of the command
ex: `["echo", "Hello", "World!"]`

- `run(query)` : Returns a promise, the result of your command
- `help()` : Returns a string, usage help for your function which will be displayed in `help <command>`
- `short_help()` : Returns a string, the usage help for your function, in a single line which will be displayed in `help --list`

Example with simplified `echo` :

```javascript
exports.run = (query) => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        query.shift()
        let toEcho = query.join(" ")

        let jsonRes = {
            status: "sucess",
            output: toEcho
        }

        resolve(jsonRes)
    })
}

exports.help = () => {
    return("echo : echo [arg ...]\n" +
    "Display the args, separate by a space character.")
}

exports.short_help = () => {
    return("echo [arg ...]")
}
```
