# WeBash
An API based on Socket.io and NodeJS which emulates a BASH terminal!

## I don't understand...
Always dreamed to have your website feel like a terminal ?
Build it with WeBash ! WeBash is a contraction of 'Web' and 'Bash'.

WeBash is an API based on Socket.io which will allow you to send bash commands and get their outputs.

You can, with WeBash, create a custom web-based terminal!

## How to use
The WeBash API is based on socket.io, here is how to use it with a javascript script. You will find several usage examples in `examples/`

```javascript
var socket = io.connect("https://webash.cestoliv.com")

var command_params = {
    colored: false,
    command_id: Math.random().toString(16).substr(2, 8), // random string
    command: "echo Hello WeBash!"
}
socket.emit("command", command_params) // send the command

socket.on('command_answer', (answer) => {
    console.log(answer.text)
})
```

Here is the structure of the data you need to send.
```javascript
/*
    command_args structure :
    {
        command_id: str | int; a random id for your request,
        command: str; the unix-like command,
        colored: boolean; should the answer be colored ?
    }
*/
```
And the structure of the data that you will receive.
```javascript
/*
    answer structure :
    {
        ended: boolean; is the command return finished ?,
        command_id: str | int; your random id,
        text: str; answer of your command, may be partial,
        order: int; order of the answer (for partial answer)
    }
*/
```

## Self-hosting
The `master` branch is always stable and working, whereas the `testing` branch is where the developers work, so you should not use it. When a new feature is ready, we will merge it into `master`.

To host an instance, start by cloning the repository :

```
git clone https://github.com/taokann/WeBash.git
cd WeBash
npm install
npm start
```

### Systemd
*You can use webash.service to start the bot as a systemd service.*

    sed -i "s?^WorkingDirectory=.*?WorkingDirectory=$(pwd)?g" webash.service

    cp webash.service /etc/systemd/system/webash.service

    sudo systemctl start webash

### .env
Customize your instance by modifying the `.env` file!
- `PORT` : Were your WeBash instance will listen

## Contribute
First of all, thank you for contributing!

### Adding command
To add a command, create a file named after it in `res/commands`

Then you will have to create three functions:

- `run(query)` : Returns a promise, resolved when your command is ended
- `help()` : Returns a string, usage help for your function which will be displayed in `help <command>`
- `short_help()` : Returns a string, the usage help for your function, in a single line which will be displayed in `help --list`

Example with simplified `echo.js` :

```javascript
/*
 *
 * File name: res/commands/echo.js
 * Description: the echo command

 */

exports.run = (command_args, socket) => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        query.shift()
        let toEcho = query.join(" ")

        socket.emit("command_answer", {
            ended: false,
            command_id: command_args.command_id,
            text: toEcho
        })

        resolve()
    })
}

exports.help = () => {
    return("echo : echo [arg ...]\n" +
    "Display the args, separate by a space character.")
}

exports.short_help = () => {
    return("echo [arg ...]")
}
```
