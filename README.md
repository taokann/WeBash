# WeBash
A javascript terminal emulator for websites
A nodeJS API that provides output of commands you sent to it

## I don't understand...
Always dreamed to have your website feel like a terminal ?
Build it with WeBash ! WeBash is a contraction of 'Web' and 'Bash'.


The users will be able to navigate throught your website (or just a part of it) using commands provided by WeBash API. If you choose to use WeBash for a entire website, it will be one-page : WeBash will carry informations from other pages to bring them to the user, who does not move from your CLI.
Note that you have to build the command line interface, WeBash only provides output of commands.

## Commands
You can get the commands list by sending 'help' to the API.
You can suggest new commands by opening an issue on GitHub.
The project is still under developpement, important commands may be missing because we are working on them.

## How to use it ?
The requests must be sent to https://webash.colivier.dev/api/v1/<your command here>
You will get the output in response.

## Self-hosting
The `master` branch is always stable and working, whereas the `testing` branch is where the developpers work, so you should not use it. When a new feature is ready, we will merge it into `master`

**You can update your instance by simply stop and rerun your server with the scripts ;)**

To host an instance, start by cloning the repository :

`git clone https://github.com/taokann/WeBash.git`

`cd WeBash`

Now you have to run `start.sh` with the way you want to use in parameter, here are the procedures according to the ways :

### Docker
Run `bash start.sh docker`.
You can specify a **local ip** for the server with `-i` :

`bash start.sh docker -i 172.22.0.100`

A **port** with `-p` :

`bash start.sh docker -p 8085`

A **name** for the container with `-n` :

`bash start.sh docker -n webash`

#### Defaults params :
port : 8085

container name: webash

local ip: 172.22.0.100(:80)

#### Properly stop the container :
`bash stop.sh docker`
